Machine Learning-based ECG Analysis

Project Overview
Welcome to the "Machine Learning-based ECG Analysis" project! Our objective is to explore the application of machine learning techniques in interpreting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The project focuses on developing a robust system capable of accurately classifying ECG signals into various categories, including Normal, Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Other abnormalities, and Noisy signals.

Key Components
1. Data Processing
We start by preprocessing the ECG dataset using the pandas library. This step ensures that the dataset is of high quality and compatible with our machine learning model.

2. Model Training
Using the Random Forest classifier from the scikit-learn library, we train our model to identify patterns within ECG signals and make precise predictions. We fine-tune the model parameters to achieve optimal performance.

3. Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of our model, we employ rigorous evaluation metrics such as accuracy assessment, classification reports, and confusion matrices. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's performance across different ECG signal categories.

4. Informative Visualizations
We create informative visualizations to aid in the interpretation and understanding of our analysis. These include ECG signal plots, label distribution histograms, confusion matrices, and feature importances, which help visualize key aspects of our project.

Project Impact
"Machine Learning-based ECG Analysis" has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling healthcare professionals to swiftly and accurately identify cardiac abnormalities. By leveraging the transformative power of machine learning, we aim to improve medical diagnostics and enhance patient care.

Dataset
Our project utilizes the PhysioNet 2017 ECG Dataset, which contains a diverse range of ECG signals along with corresponding labels.
